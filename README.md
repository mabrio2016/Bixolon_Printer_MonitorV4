Label Printer proactive Monitor

This application was developed to enable proactive monitoring of label printers used in restaurants, retail, and mobile ordering. The use case involves capturing the the Printer hardware information and maintenance counters using ESC/POS commands, sending and storing the data to a cloud database. From there, the data is processed and formatted before being sent to PowerBI for visualization.

This the PowerBI dashboad with all information capured from the Label Printers.
